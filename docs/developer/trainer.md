# Trainer (Server) PyTorch Installation

PyTorch is required but installing it is not always straightforward to automate from a script.

Please see official instructions available here: <https://pytorch.org/>

If the 'Stable' option does not work for you then it is recommended to try the Preview (Nightly) build.
