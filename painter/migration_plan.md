The current structure of the `painter` module resembles a Maven project layout (`src/main/python`), which is not conventional for a Python project. Restructuring it into a standard Python `src` layout would improve maintainability and adherence to community standards. The goal is to move files into a more conventional structure without altering functionality.

### Proposed Structure

A standard Python package with a `src` layout would look something like this. I will assume the package will be named `root_painter`:

```
painter/
├── scripts/
│   ├── export_icons.py
│   └── run_pyinstaller.py
├── src/
│   └── root_painter/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── about.py
│       ├── main.py
│       ├── ... (all other modules) ...
│       └── icons/
│           ├── icon.svg
│           └── Icon.ico
└── pyproject.toml  (recommended for packaging)
```

### Path to Restructuring

Achieving this layout involves moving files and directories, which has implications for how the code runs.

1.  **Create the Python Package**:
    *   The core of the change would be to establish a proper Python package. This involves moving the Python source files from `painter/src/main/python/` to a new directory, `painter/src/root_painter/`.
    *   An empty `painter/src/root_painter/__init__.py` file should be created to mark the directory as a package.
    *   The now-empty `painter/src/main/` directory can be removed.

2.  **Relocate Scripts and Resources**:
    *   Build and utility scripts are often kept separate from the main source. The `painter/src/build/` directory could be moved to `painter/scripts/`.
    *   Resources like icons, which are used by the package, should be included with it. The `painter/src/main/icons/` directory could be moved to `painter/src/root_painter/icons/`.

### Maintaining Functionality

Moving files requires updating any code that depends on the old file paths.

*   **Imports**: As long as all Python modules are moved together, top-level imports like `import about` or `import root_painter` should continue to work, provided the execution environment correctly sets the `PYTHONPATH` to include `painter/src`. No code changes to `import` statements should be necessary initially.

*   **Resource Loading**: The summaries show several files that load other files using relative paths. These will break after the move and require updates.
    *   `painter/src/build/run_pyinstaller.py`: The reference `icon_fname = 'Icon.ico'` will need to be updated to point to the icon's new location (e.g., `src/root_painter/icons/Icon.ico`).
    *   `painter/src/main/icons/export.py`: This script reads `'icon.svg'`. Its logic depends on its working directory. After moving it, paths will need to be adjusted.
    *   `painter/src/main/python/root_painter.py`: The call `QtGui.QIcon('missing.png')` assumes the file is in the current working directory. To make this robust, the path should be relative to the module, perhaps by using `importlib.resources`.

*   **Build Process**: The PyInstaller script (`run_pyinstaller.py`) will need the most attention. Paths to the main script, icons, and any other packaged data will need to be updated to reflect the new directory structure.
